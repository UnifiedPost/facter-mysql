This facter allows you to retrieve information from MySQL.

For the moment the version (mysql_version), all the returned values
of SHOW STATUS are available as a fact (prefixed with mysql_), so 
"open_files" becomes "mysql_open_files" and
the returned values of SHOW SLAVE STATUS prefixec with mysql_replica_ 

The goal of this facter was to be able to use it within mcollective.


Some examples:
=============
with facter:
------------
[root@delvaux facter]# facter mysql_version 2>/dev/null
5.5.10
[root@delvaux facter]# facter mysql_max_used_connections 2>/dev/null
3

with mcollective:
-----------------
